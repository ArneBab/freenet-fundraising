* Why?

** Why Freenet?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I worry about my child and the Internet all the time, even though she' too young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I worry that 10 or 15 years from now, she will come to me and say 'Daddy, where were you when they took freedom of the press away from the Internet?'

Good content often comes from small publishers.

** Measured Network Structure

#+caption: Link length distribution in Freenet. The green line would be an ideal network. Blue would be a random network. Red is the measured distribution. Randomization from local requests, churn and inhomogenity in the network skew the distribution.
