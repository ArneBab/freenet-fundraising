* What Freenet can do

Freenet enables secure peer-to-peer communication and censorship-resistant publishing in partially hostile environments. We provide anonymity with reliable pseudonyms and decentralized publishing without single points of of failure; we also provide a darknet-mode with secure connections between friends. To achieve this functionality, the Freenet team solved numerous technical challenges, including global connectivity over restricted routes using a small-world structure, as well as spam resistance in anonymous networks. The next step for the Freenet project is polishing it for specific workflows to make it the tool of choice for people who can benefit strongly from using it - starting with journalists and whistleblowers.

They are the ones who are in dire need of features like the ones provided by Freenet:

- The journalist in a countrywide newspaper, maintaining a point-of-contact to anonymous sources without requiring lots of infrastructure on the side of the journalist or the source.

- The whistleblower in a medium-sized state-contractor, sending documents to a journalist and being avaiable for questions to verify their origin without disclosing the whistleblower’s real identity to the journalist (or anyone else).


* Why we need you

Making these use cases accessible will be a lot of work. Freenet can already be used for them today, if you know what you are doing. Even then, setup requires time, patience, and experience with security tools. Journalists are always lacking the first, whistleblowers should not need the third and the second should be required by no one who uses a computer. It has all the problems, Poul Henning-Kamp pointed out at Fosdem2014:

While Freenet is at the point where it actually works well on the technical side - including crucial features like exchanging files invisibly with only a password, spam-resistant anonymous comments and email without the possibility to spy on metadata - Freenet always suffered from mediocre to bad user interfaces and rough edges like high delays on simple tasks, database corruption, and complex multi-step workflows for basic use cases like posting to a forum, as well as lots of unrealized potential from existing features and actual unmerged features due to lacking programmer hours to review and polish contributed code.

* What we want to do

We want to change this, one use case at a time. We want to allow ordinary users to tap into all the features in Freenet and realize the goal of true censorship resistance which is the core of the mission of Freenet. But that will require concentrated effort and lots of solid legwork - the kind of work which has to be done but does not give the coding-credibility or fame which draws many volunteers.

For this we need your help. To realize the potential of Freenet, we want to finance two or more full-time developers who will focus on one specific use case at a time and polish the user experience to make each use case easily accessible to its target group.


Our ideal group would look like the following:

- Three Programmers: One dedicated to core development, one for plugins and one who ties both spaces together so we can ensure code review of all the different parts. The core developer needs serious skill in working with legacy Java code and improving it iteratively, as well as in security. At least one of the developers needs serious experience with Windows.

- Two UI/UX designers who can code front end. At least one of them with solid prior experience on making complex decisions easy to take. Usable privacy tools are one of the big usability challenges out there.

- One product manager who has experience managing free software projects.  The task is to pique the enthusiasm of the development community, and get volunteers to improve the core functionality of Freenet, develop apps and plugins, etc. (We need that because we suck at this.)

- One community manager -- the "go-to person" for users in the field, e.g. the person whom journalists can contact to get set up using Freenet. The community manager is also responsible for managing social media, especially Twitter, Facebook, blog. Has to be able to work with the current very diverse userbase. (We need that because we suck at this, and keeping contact with journalists is essential for spreading Freenet -- and as such to realize its mission.)

- One fundraising coordinator and director -- in charge of fundraising, as well as all of those other managerial tasks that have to get done, e.g. dealing with the accounts, taxes and payroll.

TODO: Add cost estimates. This much money → we can do this in this amount of time. Eight people require at least 500k per year, and we need ensured funding for at least two years, so developers can get fully invested.


* Our two year vision

With this team, we should be able within at most two years to get Freenet into a state where it makes whistleblowing safe and easy, as in the following example. Everything written below is already possible with the current capabilities of Freenet, but much less convenient than described here.

Nick is a journalist. He has been active in Freenet for a few months, using a small computer running in his office. He maintains a website in Freenet which he links from the site from the newspaper he works for, and he republishes some of his articles to Freenet to spread information about his work to anonymous people. On this website he publishes an email address for contacting him over Freenet, and he regularly gets feedback to his articles from anonymous and non-anonymous people alike.

Janice is working for a big military contractor. She has been questioning the effect of her work for years, and last year she got information about a secret project she cannot reconcile with her conscience. She wants to contact a journalist anonymously to check whether he is interested in the information, and if so perhaps she would provide some documents about the secret project.

One week ago she talked to a friend about this, and the friend passed her Nick's business card, along with a special USB stick from her friend. She can use the special software on the USB stick (Linux Live System) to connect to Freenet without leaving any trace on her notebook or having to install any new application.

Janice now goes to a bar with internet access, puts the USB stick into her laptop and starts it. A browser starts and shows a list of anonymous websites within Freenet, including the site from Nick. After she is certain that Nick is the right person to contact, she clicks on his contact address.

The address brings her to a screen where she can compose a message and then send it anonymously to Nick. Freenet shows her the confirmation “message saved. Do you have an existing pseudonym you want to use or do you want to create a new one?” Janice clicks on "select new pseudonym”. Freenet prints the message “Your new pseudonym is Koyah_McLaughlin (randomly generated). Please write down the following key (cryptographically secure code) or take a photo of its QR image. You can use that key to connect with your pseudonym from any computer that has access to Freenet.” Janice takes a photo of the black-and-white QR image on her screen in order to reuse the pseudonym at a later time.

Then she orders a coffee and reads on: “Your message is being delivered. Please give Freenet a few minutes to upload it.” Then she watches a progressbar fill up. Just as she finishes her coffee, Freenet shows her that the message is delivered. Janice shuts down her laptop, pays in cash and leaves the bar. Since she only ran a Live Linux, nothing was written to her notebook and all traces of her actions disappear when it powers down.

The next day Nick comes home and checks his messages. He instantly sees the new message sent via Freenet from Janice, identified as Koyah_McLaughlin, the pseudonym Janice used. While reading the information from Janice he feels a familiar jolt of excitement. This could be big. He crosschecks what he can, then sends a reply to Janice via Freenet. Her pseudonym allows Nick to answer her and shows him that he is communicating with the same person over time instead of several different anonymous people.

The next week, Janice goes into another bar with internet access. She orders a coffee and plugs in the USB stick. In the browser she clicks on “read messages”. Freenet asks her to type the key for her pseudonym into a text field or show its image to the webcam. Janice holds the photo of her key in front of her webcam. Freenet confirms the key and asks her to wait a few minutes while her pseudonym is being restored. Just as she finishes her coffee, she sees the new email in her inbox: Nick answered.

Over the next few weeks Nick and Janice keep in contact. Their messages are stored on hundreds of places within Freenet at once, making it impossible to delete them or to trace who sent or received them. Nick gives Janice advice on how she can keep a low profile, then he runs his story.

A few months later Nick gets another message from Janice. His news story shook up the company, but Janice was able to keep clear of major problems. Freenet helped her to keep her name out of trouble despite complete surveillance on the normal internet. 

Now she has gotten wind of another unethical project, and she wants to ensure that it does not stay hidden from the public.

* Other projects

There are some projects which try to provide support for this usecase:

- tor: Via hidden services it can provide anonymous access, but they require strong infrastructure for the journalist to keep them active when the journalist becomes inconvenient to someone in power. When the main hoster of tor sites was busted some time ago, half the hidden services went offline.

- i2p: Similar to tor, but with decentralized forums which can be migrated to other services.

- SecureDrop: Allows two-way communication, but must be maintained by the journalist, so it is again a single point of failure.

- XMPP with OTR provides encrypted communication, but does not hide the identities of the discussing parties. It cannot provide anonymity to sources.

- qabel: Server-based, tries to cash in by making the parent company the only one which is allowed to make money with it, which [[http://draketo.de/light/english/politics/free-culture-danger-noncommercial][is a big problem for a community]]. Not GPL-compatible.

* Future Usecases

After we get Freenet into a state where it is the definite tool for journalists and whistleblowers, we can turn to other usecases to make easy:

- the social network which respects privacy by design, 
- a comment system for static websites, 
- a decentral, anonymous programming platform, 
- a core utility for exchanging files with your friends,
- … and so on.

All the  foundations are laid, but most of them are inaccessible for general users and inconvenient even for advanced users.

High profile use cases could be easier anonymous publication and collaboration:

-  The activists in Syria publishing their experiences for journalists in other countries to take up. Most Facebook pages from Syria are gone. “Facebook pages are the only outlet that allows Syrians and media activists to convey the events and atrocities in Syria to the world”² which means that right now, conveying events from Syria to the world means disclosing your identity. And this has dire consequences: “On December 9, five men stormed her organization’s office in the Damascus suburb of Douma and kidnapped her, along with her husband and two colleagues”. With Freenet a news site can be published anonymously without requiring lots of resources and especially without requiring any constantly available hardware. And everyone can copy a site in Freenet

-  Political activists in the UK keeping in contact and working together without revealing their group structures. Just three years ago the Guardian reported about complaints from activists that “dozens of politically linked Facebook accounts have been removed or suspended”.¹ This easily disrupts group structures and can as such be an efficient way to silence the opposition. Due to complete surveillance of communications, it is possible to determine essential people in a group and dissolve the group  with minimal effort and backlash. Freenet can hide these structures and thus stop part of the network analysis.
